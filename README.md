# Assembler

This project contains a C language code which work in a similar manner to the 1-pass & 2-pass of a typical SIC machine. The program takes input in the form of a SIC code. It addresses the SIC program, creates symtab. It further generates an intermediate file and using this file, a text record is generated. Now, an absolute loader plays its role. It shows how the text record will look if the file is loaded into main memory.
